Graph Embedding in Quantum Computers

Summer 2023 Code & Data
========================

Embera
------

**Directory Description/Notes**
* embera-main
	- contains a separate README.md based on the original download instructions from https://github.com/joseppinilla/embera/tree/main

* embera-0.0.1a0-py3.10.egg
	- with the way the repository originally ran, all files that were accessed when running an example script went through an embera-0.0.1a0-py3.10.egg.egg file that I converted into a folder to be able to change the 'backend code'
	- files in the original repository embera/embera do not get accessed when example code is run

**Download Instructions:**
*The best way to transfer this code to your machine to ensure you have all the proper Python packages will most likely be beginning from the original Embera repository at https://github.com/joseppinilla/embera/tree/main and following the README.md installation instructions there first*

1. Follow the original README.md instructions by Pinilla at https://github.com/joseppinilla/embera/tree/main 
2. Replace the 'embera-0.0.1a0-py3.10.egg' file inside your ..../python3.10/site-packages/ folder and replace it with the "quantum_embedding/Embera/embera-0.0.1a0-py3.10.egg" folder in this GitHub
3. Replace the original embera/examples folder with the quantum_embedding/Embera/embera-main/examples folder in this GitHub
4. Replace the original embera/tests folder with the quantum_embedding/Embera/embera-main/tests folder in this GitHub
5. Replace the original embera/embera folder with the quantum_embedding/Embera/embera-main/embera folder in this GitHub
