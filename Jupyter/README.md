------

**graph_embed.ipynb**
Contains code for most graph types, with flexible inputs to encapsulated functions.

**complete-, fixed_degree-, power_law-, random_degree.ipynb**
Contain code for special plots for each graph type, respectively.

**complete2.ipynb**
Contains code to run Minorminer and Busclique on all DWave topologies + 1 non-DWave topology example. Also contains code to draw the embeddings.

**graphs.ipynb**
